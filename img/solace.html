                        <p>I am currently 5 months into my 8 month co-op at Solace, which is middleware event-driven networking broker that helps enterprises leverage real-time data. The details and visuals of my work are under NDA since the features I worked on have not been released yet, but I would be happy to chat about my design process and learning outcomes so far from this co-op.</div>

                    <p> This project gave me the opportunity to contribute to the entire design process, from collaborating with stakeholders to ensure alignment on business and user needs, to designing interactions and layouts, and ultimately presenting design mockups for review with the UX team, product owner, and lead developers. </div>

                    <p> I proposed a new organizational structure and layout for the account settings page to better align with both user and business needs, and successfully presented my ideas to stakeholders, securing their buy-in. </p>

                        <h3> 2) </h3>
                        <p> Every designer brings a unique perspective to the design process, so getting feedback from the UX team was valuable for me to make more informed design decisions after considering new perspectives I had not thought of.</p>
                        <h3> 3) </h3>
                        <p> During UX reviews, If I am unable to explain my rationale for a design decision, I should question whether it is aligning with user needs or business goals. Feedback helped reflect on my design decisions and make sure they are user-centered.</p>

                    <p> Working iteratively and seeking feedback early on in the design process allowed for more time to make improvements and refine my work, ultimately leading to better outcomes.
                    </p> 
                    <h3>2) Value of Diverse Perspectives </h3>
                    <p> Every designer brings their own unique perspective, and getting feedback from the UX team was invaluable. It helped me make more informed design decisions by introducing new viewpoints that I hadn’t considered.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2) Design Rationale and User-Centered Focus </h3>
                    <p> During UX reviews, if I struggled to clearly explain the rationale behind a design decision, it made me reflect on whether it truly aligned with user needs and business goals. The feedback process helped me ensure that my designs were user-centered and grounded in purpose.
