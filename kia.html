Thus, we saw a significant opportunity to improve customer satisfaction by optimizing Kia's desktop experience in order to support informed decision making and mitigate discrepancies between online research and in-person dealership interactions.

                    <h3>1) You don't need to start off as an expert in the domain you're designing in. </h3>
                    <p> Our team, initially unfamiliar with the automotive industry, conducted thorough research to understand our customer group. This lack of domain knowledge actually turned out to be an advantage, as it prevented us from making assumptions about our users and encouraged a more empathetic approach to design. </p>
                    <h3>2) Predict stakeholder doubts and prepare evidence to ease these doubts. </h3>
                    <p> When presenting our designs, a recurring concern emerged regarding dealership employees' potential reception of our price comparison feature. As the feature's proposer, I addressed this by providing evidence that it only centralized existing information, demonstrating its necessity to position Kia competitively.</p>
