                    <h2> Who is Heritage Burnaby? </h2>
                    <p> Heritage Burnaby is an online repository for Burnaby's historical archives, with the goal of promoting knowledge and exploration of Burnaby's history and building community bonds. They have an interactive map called the <a href="https://gis.burnaby.ca/storymaps/chartingchangeatlas/index.html" target="on-click">Charting Change Atlas</a> which was created in 2010 to showcase how Burnaby's landscape has changed over time.

                    <h2> Charting Change Atlas </h2>
                    <p> Since launching in 2010, the interactive map was initially popular but has not been updated since its release and became inactive, leading our client to wonder whether the map had potential in drawing current interest if it was redesigned.

                    <h2> People don't feel personally motivated to engage with the map. </h2>
                    <p> User research revealed people were confused about the map's purpose, found the information interesting but impersonal, and were frustrated by its usability issues stemming from the map's outdated purpose and target audience. This prevented users from wanting to revisit the map, leading to our <strong>challenge </strong>of re-aligning the map to current interests.</p>

                    <p> 
                        In order to address this lack of personal connection, we redesigned the map to attract visitors through personalized storytelling, by allowing anyone with a connection to Burnaby to share their stories and photos connected to historical landmarks on the map, which was a solution validated by findings from our participatory workshop.

                        Then, I created mid-fidelity wireframes to finetune the <strong> integration </strong> of the new community stories feature with the existing historical information, with consideration of the pain points from user research as well as key insights from the competitive analysis:

                    <h4> Final Takeaways </h4>
                    <h2>What I learned...</h2>
                    <h3> 1) Getting the design right > getting the right design.</h3>
                        <p>Our professor (Gillian Russell) emphasized Bill Buxton's concept from "Sketching User Experiences" during our project: the distinction between getting the right design and getting the design right, which made me understand the importance of focusing not just on achieving a design solution, but ensuring that the solution effectively addresses the users' needs.</p>
                        <h3> 2) Designers need to be flexible. </h3>
                        <p> The iterative design process demands continual refinement of our problem statement. Prioritizing decisions aligned with user needs across multiple iterations, I learned the necessity of flexibility as a designer, and continually adapting design choices as needed. </p>
                    <h2>Things to improve...</h2>
                    <p>  Due to the project's scope and time limitations, we couldn't carry out usability testing to validate our design. However, conducting usability testing would be my next step to further develop this project. </p>
