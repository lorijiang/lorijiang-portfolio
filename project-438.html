                    <p> Despite ranking highest among mass market brands 
                        in vehicle dependency, Kia ranked last in customer satisfaction at dealerships, indicating a significant opportunity for improvement through experience design.

                    <p> Kia customers encounter uncertainty and transparency issues on vehicle pricing between the online research process and in-person dealership interactions, leading to lack of trust among customers.

                            2) A <strong> post-festival microsite</strong> providing insight into artists’ creative processes and personal
                            interests, fostering deeper connections between
                            fans and artists, and <strong> sustaining engagement</strong> after the festival.

                <h3> Areas of Design Intervention</h3>
                <p> We saw a significant opportunity for improvement through experience design, in improving Kia's desktop website in order to improve pricing transparency to help customers make more informed decisions, as well as streamline the transition from researching online to going into the dealership to talk with a sales representative or book a test drive.</p>
