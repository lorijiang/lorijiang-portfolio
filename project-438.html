                    <p>
                        The existing website only shows if similar vehicles are in stock. Therefore, we added a dedicated dealership offer page for direct comparison of inventory prices across Canadian dealerships, aligning Kia with top competitors like Buick, Chevrolet, and Mitsubishi, known for strong vehicle dependency and customer satisfaction rankings.

                    <p> To further bridge the online to in-person experience, we added the ability to pre-fill required documents such as proof of insurance online, which are normally done in person, to reduce wait times in person and expedite the purchasing process.

                    <p> <strong> For customers</strong>, the intervention reduces cognitive overhead in the purchasing process and enhances transparency between online and in-person interactions, ensuring customers feel confident in making an informed decision for their ideal vehicle. <strong> For Kia</strong>, increased customer trust and satisfaction increases the probability of purchase completions and also future purchases from customers.</p>

                    <h3>1) You don't need to start off as an expert in the domain you're designing in. </h3>
                    <p> The benefits of choosing a topic completely unfamiliar to us was that the team was able to truly practice user-centred design thinking in empathizing and understanding their needs.</p>
                    <h3>2) User testing helps overcome false assumptions. </h3>
                    <p> Through multiple rounds of user testing, we were able recognize and correct many of our assumptions, and reframe our problem statement.</p>
