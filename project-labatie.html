                    <p> Organizers and artists devote considerable effort to hosting the annual 18-day La Bâtie festival. However, outside of performances, fans lack opportunities to engage with artists or remain connected to La Bâtie between the annual festivals. </h2>

                    <h4> Solution</h4>

                            The design solution consists of two parts:

                            <br> <br>
                            2) A <strong> post-festival microsite</strong> providing insight into artists’ creative processes and personal
                            interests, fostering deeper connections between
                            fans and artists, and <strong> sustaining engagement</strong> after the festival.

                    <h3> What distinguishes La Bâtie from other festivals?</h3>
                    <p> La Bâtie Festival de Geneve is on its 47th year and is an 18-days long which is more than most performance festivals. Its multidisciplinary nature means there are almost 20 categories of creative genres and over 100 artists (in 2023). </p>
                    <h4> The Problem </h4>
                    <p> For the amount of hard work from artists, all year round to put on a festival of this size, audiences are only able to appreciate its work for the 18-days duration, and even then the festival goers are likely not attending all 18-days. </p>

                <p> 
                    The process of creating graphic assets began with analyzing the graphic design work of <a href="https://www.jetset.nl/"> Experimental Jetset </a>, an Amsterdam based design studio distinguishable by their expressive style.

                    Using the design qualities we extracted and adapted from Experimental Jetset, the team went through a highly collaborative process of experimenting with type, colour, and imagery to create 3 distinct art directions. I've annotated my key contributions:

                        <h3> 1) In teamwork, prioritize the best work over diplomacy.</h3>
                        <p>  When working in a team, I learned that even though my work may not be used in the final product, it is equally valuable in the iterative process to increase our opportunity for success.</p>
                        <h3> 2) Wide explorations early on leads to optimal results. </h3>
                        <p> The teaching team was impressed with our final product and I think one of the crucial factors in our success was that we generated hundreds of iterations, leveraging cumulative decisions to carry over the best work into later phases of the project.</p>
                        <h3> 3) Let go of emotional attachments.</h3>
                        <p> I created work that I was really proud of and even if it wasn't used in the final product, and I have (mostly) learned to accept it and keep moving forward.</p>
