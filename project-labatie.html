                    <p> Organizers and artists work tirelessly to hold the annual 18-day La Bâtie Festival de Genève, but there is no way for customers to stay engaged with La Batie when the festival is not running.</h2>

                        <p> 
                            The design solution consists of two parts: 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            1) pre-event graphic assets in the form of promotional posters placed around relevant areas in Genève and merchandise for purchase before and during festival to get <strong> create anticipation </strong> prior to the festival.
                            <br> <br>
                            2) a post-festival microsite offering an
                            intimate glimpse into artists’ creative processes and personal
                            passions. Facilitating deeper connections, it <strong> bridges the gap between
                            fans and artists</strong>, ensuring to forge a more personal relationship
                            between them, and sustaining engagement beyond the festival.

                    <h3> What distinguishes La Bâtie from other festivals?</h3>
                    <p> La Bâtie Festival de Geneve is on its 47th year and is an 18-days long which is more than most performance festivals. Its multidisciplinary nature means there are almost 20 categories of creative genres and over 100 artists (in 2023). </p>
                    <h4> The Problem </h4>
                    <p> For the amount of hard work from artists, all year round to put on a festival of this size, audiences are only able to appreciate its work for the 18-days duration, and even then the festival goers are likely not attending all 18-days. </p>

                <p> 
                    The process of creating graphic assets began with analyzing the graphic design work of <a href="https://www.jetset.nl/"> Experimental Jetset </a>, an Amsterdam based design studio distinguishable by their expressive style. We ended up adapting some of their design qualities into our own:

                        <h3> 1) In teamwork, prioritize the best work over diplomacy.</h3>
                        <p>  When working in a team, I learned that even though my work may not be used in the final product, it is equally valuable in the iterative process to increase our opportunity for success.</p>
                        <h3> 2) Wide explorations early on leads to optimal results. </h3>
                        <p> The teaching team was impressed with our final product and I think one of the crucial factors in our success was that we generated hundreds of iterations, leveraging cumulative decisions to carry over the best work into later phases of the project.</p>
                        <h3> 3) Let go of emotional attachments.</h3>
                        <p> I created work that I was really proud of and even if it wasn't used in the final product, and I have (mostly) learned to accept it and keep moving forward.</p>
