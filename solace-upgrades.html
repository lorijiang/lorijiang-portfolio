                        <p> During my co-op at Solace, I designed a customer-triggered upgrade feature, including UIs, screen interactions, and visual specs, while validating designs through weekly reviews and presented the final design to stakeholders, receiving highly positive feedback and approval.</div>

                    <p> The service upgrade process is currently manual and requires appointment scheduling between customers and Product Engineers. When versions are deprecated, this coordination can cause delays of up to 6 weeks. Additionally, once the upgrade starts, limited progress feedback creates uncertainty for customers.</p>

                <h2> User Flows</h2>
                <p> After meeting with the product owner and lead developer to align on the key requirements, business goals, user goals, and technical limitations, I created high level flows to map out the interactions needed for the user to complete the upgrade. Based on feedback, this was the final flow chosen: </p>
                    <!-- <p>I learned that these high level mocks are effective in removing the distracting details of the page and communicating the most important parts of the flow in isolation. </p> -->

            <div class="text-width section">
                <h2> Interaction Design</h2>
                <p> I created detailed high-fidelity wireframes with annotated design rationale to illustrate user interactions during the upgrade process. The wireframes covered the full flow, including feature discovery, decision pathways, error states, and completion messages.

                <p> This new customer-triggered upgrade feature was just released last month and aims to improve efficiency by reducing Product Engineers' workload to assisting during error states only, while offering customers quicker and more transparent upgrades.

                   <br> <br> The MVP has been released internally at Solace, and we are currently gathering feedback from internal employees for improvements. I am currently working on the next phase of the feature, which involves adding a scheduling component for more predictable upgrades. </p>

                    <h3> 1) Cross-functional teams bring diverse perspectives.</h3>
                    <p> Reviewing my work with designers, product owners, and engineers, helped me gain diverse perspectives throughout the project and as a designer, I learned to balance business needs, user needs, and technical limitations to find the best solution. </p>
                    <h3> 2) Know your audience when presenting. </h3>
                    <p> I presented to UX, product owners, and developers throughout the project, learning to adjust the level of detail, context, and questions in my presentations to suit each audience. With practice, I received positive feedback and approval during my final stakeholder presentation, concluding the project on a high note. </p>
